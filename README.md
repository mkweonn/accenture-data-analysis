# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization

## Objective:
Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture. Analyzed sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

## Key Tasks:
- Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions and inform client's business decision
- Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders

## Skills Used:
Excel | Data Analysis | Data Visualization | Presentation | Tableau

### Data Modeling and Cleaning
- Based on the client's business question (to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity), we chose "Reaction", "Content", and "Reaction Types" files based on the data model.
- To clean the data, we used Excel to remove rows that have missing values, changed the data types of some values within columns, standardized/specified values, removed duplicates, and removed rows not relevant to the task at hand. We then used VLOOKUP to merge the tables for analysis.

### Data Visualization
We then communicated our findings with a presentations, presenting insights and recommendations. I further visualized the data in Tableau. (*Note: The Tableau month chart focuses on a filtered data set, explaining the discrepancy with the slide deck.)
